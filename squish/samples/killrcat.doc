KillrCat
========

This is a five-minute hack (and it probably shows) that acts as a
KILLRDOG replacement for Squish bases.  Use at your own risk.


Distribution files
==================

KILLRCAT.EXE - KillrCat for MS-DOS
KILLRCAP.EXE - KillrCap for OS/2
KILLRCAT.C   - C source code
KILLRCAT.H   - Header file

KILLRCAT is reasonably generic.  However, you need MSGAPI if you
wish to recompile it.


Configuration file format
=========================

AREA <area>
        <flag>  <text>
        ...

<area> should be the path of the area to scan.  To scan a Squish area,
include a '$' in front of the area's path.

<flag> can be either 't', 'f', 's' or 'b', indicating that KillrCat
is to search the TO field, the FROM field, the SUBJECT field,
or the BODY (respectively).

<text> indicates the text that KillrCat is to delete.  Any messages
which match the specified criteria will get nuked.

You can specify more than one flag/text combination per area, but
you can only put one on a line.  Put a blank line after the last
one before starting a new area definition.
